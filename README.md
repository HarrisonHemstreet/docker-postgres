This is just a postgres docker boilerplate for getting set up with an ephemeral database. This method is my favorite for working on 
personal projects. Working with a local instalation of postgres can be annoying. The purpose of this repo is to avoid the annoyances of working with postgres locally.

Just make sure you make an `init.sql` file to seed your db.
